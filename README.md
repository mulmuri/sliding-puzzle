Fastest Sliding Puzzle Solution Ever!

It is known that the IDA* algorithm generally outperforms A* in terms of speed. This solution employs IDA* to great effect.

It is up to 10 times faster than well-optimized IDA* solution codes commonly found online. This solution enhances the heuristic according to the metric of time complexity.

Furthermore, it is scalable to sliding puzzles of any size, ensuring consistent performance. In contrast, some solutions that employ peculiar heuristics may seem effective for N×N-sized puzzles but can exhibit significant performance degradation when applied to N×M-sized puzzles.
